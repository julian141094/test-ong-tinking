## Getting Started üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

Hello, my name is Julian and this is my test. If you wanna run the code, please install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

And then, run this please:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the test.



## Implemented Technologies

Please, let me show you all of tools that i used, to build this test:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - Formik is the world's most popular open source form library for React and React Native.
- And another more tools üòé .


You can check the rest on package.json file! 

## Development Vision

When developing this code, try to maintain the atomic component design paradigm, making (where possible) for each element of the sections a specific functional component. Given the number of elements built, manage your communication in two main ways, the first is through a global state manager (redux), and the second is through parent / child communication between the closest components. It should be noted that large UI libraries were not implemented in the project, but rather, it was chosen to make most of the components shown in the figma prototype with native web technologies directly. Looking to maintain an order and leave the possibility that each part of the project can be scaled.

## Development Details

All the test requirements were met, with the exception of two items, the first and most specific of the items that I could not complete is to place a zombra on each item that is added to the list of recipes. On the other hand, the second but less specific item is the design of the sorting filter options, however, it is worth noting that at a functional level this filter performs its respective functions in the list of recipes.

Thank you very much for all the time and dedication, blessings! üôè
